        <p style="font-weight: 500">QiGong (pronounced chee-gong) is an ancient Chinese exercise and healing technique that involves controlled breathing and movement to promote a meditative state. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 500">The state of our current society has our bodies producing chemicals that keep us up with the pace of everything. This state of hyperawareness devoids our bodies the opportunity to focus on its own healing. It devoids it of the peace and tranquility that we deserve.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 500">QiGong helps you get back to that state. By connecting your breath, mind and body you synchronize everything into a calmer state of being which, in turn, provides room for healing to start within.</p>
