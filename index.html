        <p>The light in a kaleidoscope symbolizes the ever changing and endless possibilities contained in the human experience.
Your unique patterns are symbols of change and growth.  The symmetry represents your return to balance and harmony.</p>
<p>Monika’s Kaleidoscope Fusion approach fuses choice elements from different modalities.  
Together, these forces offer you a tailored made combination of unique healing energies
that you just can’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p><b>As a result, you’ll have…</b><br>
    • A new way to look at your events and reoccurring symptoms.<br>
    • Your complex life will be more purposeful and structured.<br>
    • What were once Illusions and delusions are put into a clear perspective.<br>
    • A new appreciation of the beautiful chaos that was happening in your life.</p>
